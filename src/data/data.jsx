I currently work as a frontend developer, but my personality is open to constant learning, to working as a team to solve the tasks that are necessary to achieve any proposed objective. My main goal is to become a fullstack developer, gain experience, constantly train myself to be able to provide the services that any large project needs. For all people, being able to make a personal career is almost the most important thing, which is why I like companies or projects that allow you to take that path little by little.',
